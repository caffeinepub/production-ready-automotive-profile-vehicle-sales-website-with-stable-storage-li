  "summary": "The diff introduces a new backend migration module and wires it into `backend/main.mo`, plus updates `project_state.json`. The provided truncated diff does not include any visible changes to `init()`, `preupgrade()`, `postupgrade()`, or the super-admin seeding logic, so the requested seeding relocation cannot be verified from the evidence shown.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-58",
      "requirement": "Move all Super Admin seeding execution so it runs only during canister initialization (system func init) and never during upgrade lifecycle hooks (remove from preupgrade/postupgrade, add init guard `if (adminUsers.size() == 0) { seedSuperAdmin(); }`).",
      "reason": "The truncated `backend/main.mo` excerpt shows imports and type/state declarations but does not show any `system func init()`, nor removal of seeding from `preupgrade()`/`postupgrade()`, nor the requested guard around `seedSuperAdmin()`. With the diff evidence provided, these required changes are not demonstrated.",

    {
      "description": "Introduced a new migration module and wired it into the main canister actor (`import Migration \"migration\";`, `(with migration = Migration.run)`).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest focuses only on relocating Super Admin seeding from upgrade hooks to `init()` and explicitly says to keep stable save/restore logic untouched. Adding a migration module/system is not requested and suggests changes to migration/persistence plumbing beyond seeding relocation.",

      "description": "Updated `project_state.json` metadata.",

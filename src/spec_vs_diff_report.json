  "summary": "REQ-79, REQ-80, REQ-81, REQ-82, and REQ-83 appear largely implemented: admin nav active-state now distinguishes vehicle categories via query-param matching; the admin vehicle dialog was expanded with Variants/Technical Specs/Commercial Features editors; media pages show grid, empty-state \"No media yet.\", and session-expiry messaging; public vehicle cards/listing grids and both vehicle detail pages were visually polished with placeholder image fallbacks. One unrequested admin nav item (\"Auth Debug Test\") was added.",

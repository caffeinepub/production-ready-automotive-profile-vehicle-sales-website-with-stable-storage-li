# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Redeploy the existing backend and frontend to the Internet Computer with no functional changes.

**Planned changes:**
- Redeploy current backend and frontend artifacts as-is.
- Run the existing post-deployment checklist (manual smoke test of public and admin routes) from `frontend/REDEPLOYMENT.md`.

**User-visible outcome:** The app remains functionally unchanged, but is freshly redeployed and verified via manual smoke tests on public and admin routes.

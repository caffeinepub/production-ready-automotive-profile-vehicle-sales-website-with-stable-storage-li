  "summary": "Automotive company profile + vehicle sales website with production-ready backend/frontend separation, stable persistence (upgrade/redeploy safe), live CMS admin panel, media manager, SEO/performance, product & article interactions, and seeded content.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Use stable persistence only (no in-memory) and ensure upgrade/redeploy-safe data migrations with auto-restore after redeploy.",
    "Separate backend and frontend; include persistent media storage in stable storage (not blob URLs).",
    "Admin CMS at /admin with secure authentication and role-based authority.",
    "Define stable collections for content + interactions (likes/shares/comments) and visitor statistics.",
    "TanStack Router: ensure RouterProvider is rendered exactly once (avoid double RouterProvider rendering via both rootRoute component and App.tsx) to prevent production blank screen.",
    "Storage foundation injection scope: backend-only changes for full stable persistence; do NOT modify UI or layout.",
    "Admin CMS system injection scope: implement /admin panel only (CRUD + draft/publish + delete + media upload + multi-admin roles + secure session auth) and do NOT modify any public frontend pages.",
    "Admin auth scope: implement email/password login with password hashing and secure session token stored in cookie/session; session must persist across refresh, protect all /admin routes, and support logout session invalidation. Do not modify any public frontend pages.",
    "Seed initial admin user in stable `adminUsers` for email/password auth; keep change scope backend/admin-CMS only (no public/frontend modifications).",
    "Any debug endpoint/logging for admin auth must be admin-only, must not return password hashes/tokens, and should be removable/disabled for production after verification."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Production/live page shows blank screen after deploy due to frontend crash: project uses `next-themes` ThemeProvider even though frontend is Vite + React (not Next.js), causing app to fail before rendering.",
    "Draft/live publish still shows white blank screen; likely caused by TanStack Router being rendered twice (RouterProvider in both rootRoute component and App.tsx), triggering an internal error and preventing render.",
    "Admin login still fails with 'Invalid Email or Password' for the seeded credentials; suspected mismatch between frontend login payload/flow and backend hashing/session verification.",
    "/admin/auth-debug is not accessible when login fails because it is protected by AdminGuard, blocking diagnosis.",
    "Seeded super admin may not exist in runtime memory at login time due to seeding only occurring in `preupgrade()` and/or reliance on legacy stable-stored hash; requires deterministic seed-on-init/upgrade + rehash using current verifier.",
    "Potential scope conflict: existing plan mentions seeding on startup and after upgrades; latest decision restricts seeding to `init()` only (no `postupgrade()`), which may leave upgraded canisters without a seeded Super Admin if stable restore does not include it.",
    "Admin auth bug: login succeeds but session is not persisted client-side, causing redirect back to login form instead of `/admin` dashboard.",
    "Login loop prevents accessing /admin dashboard; requires temporary emergency bypass to validate CMS/storage/UI independently of auth.",
    "Media library authorization failure: admin login works but media endpoints return \"Unauthorized: Only admins can view media assets\" due to media service using a different auth source (e.g., principal whitelist) than CMS session auth.",
    "Admin CMS: PassengerVehicles and CommercialVehicles editor buttons both appear active (both red) when one is selected; tab/state styling logic likely incorrect."
